# **Logger**

This is a Cross Platform dynamic library project.

This can be used in your personal projects as a dynamic library, which provides logMessage API to store all the logging procedure needed in a file.

This project identifies the current OS on which it is running, which creates a folder with respect to default logging path of the identified OS with a file inside it to store all the logging information, when logMessage API is used.
